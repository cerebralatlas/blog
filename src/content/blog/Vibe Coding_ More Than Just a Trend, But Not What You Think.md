title: "What does Vibe Coding actually mean?"
description: "My co-workers think that the concept of vibe coding can be applied to productivity. To be honest, I hate the term 'vibe coding'. It's probably misunderstood by so many individuals who aim to build AI-powered software. The term actually means that those who have never touched code can create their own tools to deal with their problems."

# What does Vibe Coding actually mean?​

​​I came across a book about 'vibe coding' in Rednote two days ago. I didn't even read a full chapter before noticing, to my surprise, that most of these books seem to promote it as a new approach for experts to build AI-powered software. But honestly, that's not what vibe coding is — let me explain why.​​

## What Vibe Coding _Really_ Is

The term was created by Andrej Karpathy earlier this year, and he was pretty clear: **It’s not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing**. It’s about using AI tools like Cursor or ChatGPT to mess around, build little tools, or solve small problems—without worrying about writing “perfect” code.

Think of it like cooking from a vague recipe: you don’t need to be a chef, and the result doesn’t have to be restaurant-quality. **It just needs to work for you**.

## Why Those Books Got It Wrong

Those new books? They’re acting like vibe coding is the next big thing in professional software development. But that’s a mistake.

Really, professional coding is about reliability, security, and maintainability—**things that vibe coding intentionally ignores**. When you’re building an app that thousands of people depend on, you can’t just rely on “vibing” your way through it. One tiny error could crash the whole system, or worse, leak sensitive data.

## The Hidden Power of Vibe Coding: For the Non-Tech Majority​

But that doesn’t mean vibe coding is useless. Certainly not. **I think it’s actually a game-changer for people who’ve never touched code before**.

Imagine that a small business owner who needs a simple tool to track inventory. With vibe coding, he could describe what he need to an AI, tweak the result a bit, and has something working by the end of the day—no coding classes required. Or a English learner who wants a quick app to simplify English learning approach. **Vibe coding makes that possible**.

The real problem with those misleading books is that they’re scaring people away. If you pick up a book that claims vibe coding is for “mastering production-grade AI tools,” you might think, “That’s not for me.”

But vibe coding _is_ for you. **It’s for the parent trying to organize a neighborhood carpool, the freelancer tracking invoices, or the kid who wants to build a silly game for their friends**.

## Vibe Coding as a Creative Gateway

Another perspective no one’s talking about? The creativity angle. Traditional coding can feel like following strict rules—like writing a formal essay. **Vibe coding is more like journaling: messy, personal, and flexible**.

You can experiment, make mistakes, and pivot without feeling like you’re “doing it wrong.” That freedom might just be what gets more people interested in tech in the first place. Why? Because **it stops feeling like a skill for “geniuses” and starts feeling like a tool for anyone with an idea**.

## Yes, There Are Downsides—But That’s Okay

Of course, there are downsides. If you rely too much on AI to write code you don’t understand, you might end up with tools that break easily or do weird and strange things.

But that’s part of the process. **Vibe coding isn’t about building something that lasts forever—it’s about solving a problem now**. And as you mess around, you might even pick up a little real coding knowledge along the way. It’s like learning to cook by making scrambled eggs: you start simple, and eventually, you get curious enough to try something harder.

## Redefine Vibe Coding

So maybe it’s time we stop letting those books define vibe coding. Let’s call it what it really is: **a gateway**. A way for people to dip their toes into creating technology without feeling overwhelmed. A reminder that tech doesn’t have to be serious or complicated to be useful.

And who knows? Maybe the next big tech innovation won’t come from a professional coder in a fancy office—**it’ll come from someone vibe coding a solution to their own tiny, everyday problem**.
