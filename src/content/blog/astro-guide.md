# Astro Complete Guide: Modern Static Site Generator

Astro is a modern static site generator that adopts the "Islands Architecture" philosophy, enabling you to build fast, content-first websites.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a brand new static site building tool with core principles:

- **Zero JavaScript by default**: Only send JavaScript to the browser when needed
- **Framework agnostic**: Supports React, Vue, Svelte, and other frameworks
- **Content-first**: Designed specifically for content-driven websites

## Core Features

### 1. Islands Architecture

Astro uses the "Islands Architecture" pattern, allowing you to create independent interactive component "islands" on static HTML pages.

```astro
---
// This part only runs at build time
import Counter from './Counter.jsx';
---

<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Static Content</h1>
    <!-- This component is an "island" -->
    <Counter client:load />
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2. Component Directives

Astro provides multiple client directives to control component hydration timing:

- `client:load` - Hydrate immediately when page loads
- `client:idle` - Hydrate when browser is idle
- `client:visible` - Hydrate when component enters viewport
- `client:media` - Hydrate when media query matches

### 3. Content Collections

Astro's content collections feature makes managing Markdown content simple:

```typescript
// src/content/config.ts
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

const blog = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.date(),
    description: z.string(),
  }),
});

export const collections = { blog };
```

## Performance Advantages

Astro's design decisions bring significant performance benefits:

1. **Smaller bundle sizes**: Only send necessary JavaScript
2. **Faster load times**: Static HTML first
3. **Better SEO**: Complete server-side rendering

## When to Choose Astro?

Astro is particularly suitable for:

- Blogs and documentation websites
- Marketing and content websites
- E-commerce websites (product pages)
- Corporate websites

## Conclusion

Astro represents a new direction in static site generation. Its "Islands Architecture" and "zero JavaScript by default" philosophy provide new possibilities for building high-performance websites. If you're looking for a modern, fast, and flexible static site solution, Astro is definitely worth trying.
